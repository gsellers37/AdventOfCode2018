# Advent of Code

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018). I used these programming problems as a way to practice and improve upon my C++. Previously, I had mostly used C instead of C++, aside from doing some sensor library and server code. My main higher level languages were Python and MATLAB (I have a background in MechE), and I wanted to work on something that was strongly typed and performant.  

# What's next?

Advent of Code 2019 may seem like what's next, but I probably plan to backtrack a bit over the year to revisit 2015-2017. I did [some of AoC 2017](https://github.com/gsellers37/AdventOfCode2017) with a friend, trying to learn JavaScript, a year ago. I'd like to finish that one up first, and then I'll probably do another in Python to solidify some of my skills there.
